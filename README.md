# Healthcare-analyzing-project@

Made a Series from Pandas, where information on Oslo University Hospital is included, i.e., hospital name, major location, main campuses, description, and/or other relevant information.

16 hospitals are chosen from the linked reference, where we have created 16 Series, each of which includes information about each spesific hospital.

Created a DataFrame from the Series generated.

Added a new column named ‘Regional Health Authority’. 

For each row in DataFrame created we have assigned a corresponding value for ‘Regional Health Authority.’
Such as: ‘Oslo University Hospital’, the value of ‘Regional Health Authority’ are filled with ‘Southern and Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority’.

Figure out an interesting problem based on data explorations from our data, which is transformed, processed and visualized.

Came to an conclusion which is demonstrated by our results.
